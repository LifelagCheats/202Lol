<details>
  
<summary> Tor configuration </summary>

<br>

> This is for systemd based linux distros, so you'll have to find another way if you use another os or another init system.
> 
```
tor --hash-password "your_password" # basically, just enter the password that you want for tor, you will get a hash (like this 16:HASH), copy the thing after the 16
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
HashedControlPassword your_hashed_password # edit that line, replace your_hashed_password with the hash you got
sudo systemctl restart tor
sudo systemctl start tor
```

> If you want to check your config, do `sudo tor -f /etc/tor/torrc --verify-config` . If you want to see the proxies are working do `curl --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050 http://check.torproject.org`

<br>

**If you're having problems, make sure on the config file (mostly located at /etc/tor/torrc), has the value `ControlPort 9051`.**
**You might also want to check if tor is listening on the ports with `ss -tlnp | grep 9050`.**
